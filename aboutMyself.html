Besides it, from my school days I had a strong attraction on handcrafts and drawing. It has become a hobby. In fact I have done many such handcraftings in my chidhood days. Those days were really wonderfull. One of the finest handcraft that I have done was making a ship by using ice-cream sticks , 25 paise coins and machies. It was really a wonderfull feeling when I completed that job. It was quite difficult for me to make the fruits using mud and cement.<span><b>........<u>see less</u></b></span>

                <big>T</big>he biggest supporters of my life are my father, mother and my elder sister. Family is a beautiful thing that not only teaches you the chapters of outside world but also make to aware about what to do and what not to do. Throughout my academic curriculum I am rigidly supported by my family. Wheneven I feel depressed , my mother always support me and helps me to overcome the situation. My Father works only as a Serviceman , but he always push me forward in my life.
                From childhood I have a sweet and spice relationship with my elder sister. We quarreled a lot over some trifling issues but after sometime this evaporets like a dust.<br><br>Like my mother and father my cousins also supports me a lot. Though we all are living in different places but at the time of Indias most sweetest retual "Bhai Fota" all my cousin brothers and sisters are gathered and enjoys a lot. It is not an exeggeration in saying that we has become a gang of cousins.
